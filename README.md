# OBS 370 – Business Analytics Project

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the **OBS 370 (Business Analytics)** module at the University of Pretoria.  
The focus was on applying **business analytics techniques** to evaluate workforce distribution and resource allocation in **non-metropolitan municipalities** across **North West, Eastern Cape, and Mpumalanga**.  

We developed an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize key metrics, uncover insights, and support data-driven decision-making for municipal management.

---

## Objectives
- Collect, clean, and structure raw municipal workforce data.  
- Create **measures, KPIs, and calculated fields** to analyze staffing patterns.  
- Use **Power BI dashboards** to visualize findings and support management decisions.  
- Provide recommendations for improved workforce efficiency in local municipalities.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI – Dashboard design, DAX calculations, KPI measures.  
- Excel – Data preprocessing and verification.  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom measures and calculations.  

---

## Key Features
- Workforce KPIs – Full-time equivalents (FTEs), workforce % by province, ranking of municipalities.  
- Comparative Analysis – Province-level breakdowns with filters for specific municipalities.  
- Visualization – Clean, professional dashboard exported to Canva for presentation polish.  
- Decision Support – Highlights shortages and inefficiencies in municipal staffing.  

---

## Example Insights
- Some provinces showed **imbalances in workforce distribution**, with smaller municipalities carrying disproportionately high workloads.  
- KPI analysis identified municipalities with **critical shortages** compared to national averages.  
- Visual dashboards allow decision-makers to **drill down by province, municipality, and staffing category**.

## Notes
- This project was developed in an academic context, but the methods and dashboards demonstrate practical **business analytics and BI reporting skills** relevant for industry use.
